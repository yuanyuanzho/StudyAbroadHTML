The following is the president's speech at Harvard, she told her own personal experience, why in the end we must go out to see the world.  </p>
                                <p>Every year to go to a strange place. - this is my own one of the requirements, can be considered a plan.</p>
                                <p>This habit seems to have been small, has continued to the present. Until today, every year I go to a strange place with the children. </p>
                                <p>For me, traveling with learning has become a tradition, and its meaning lies in its own growth.</p>
                                <p> Travel so that we really know the world </p>
                                <p>world is getting smaller and smaller, we almost every day and strangers deal with, are familiar with the first of all. The children in the world have become a family, technology to make our citizens become blurred, so that communication becomes fast, so that we have to adapt to a variety of changing social environment. </p>
                                <p>Therefore, the future of the children must be working with different people of different nationalities and living together, so to understand the whole world has become their compulsory course.</p>
